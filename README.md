# JSON-FG for Java

This library aims to make encoding and decoding of JSON-FG documents as easy as possible. This library is experimental
and was developed as a community effort during the [OGCâ€™s October 2023 Open Standards Code Sprint](https://developer.ogc.org/sprints/22/)
in London. This library is compatible with [v0.2.1](https://docs.ogc.org/DRAFTS/21-045.html) of the JSON-FG specification.

## Getting started

TODO

## Design goals

- It should be easy to use this library in conjunction with popular existing tools, such as Jackson and JTS.
- It should not introduce needless extra dependencies. It should leverage libraries which are already available.
- It should be possible to incorporate this library in different types of applications, without doing any assumptions
  about specific frameworks/libraries being used.
